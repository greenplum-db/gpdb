Feature: gpstart behave tests

    @concourse_cluster
    @demo_cluster
    Scenario: gpstart correctly identifies down segments
        Given the database is running
          And a mirror has crashed
          And the database is not running
         When the user runs "gpstart -a"
         Then gpstart should return a return code of 0
          And gpstart should print "Skipping startup of segment marked down in configuration" to stdout
          And gpstart should print "Skipped segment starts \(segments are marked down in configuration\) += 1" to stdout
          And gpstart should print "Successfully started [0-9]+ of [0-9]+ segment instances, skipped 1 other segments" to stdout
          And gpstart should print "Number of segments not attempted to start: 1" to stdout

    Scenario: gpstart starts even if the standby host is unreachable
        Given the database is running
          And the catalog has a standby master entry

         When the database is not running
          And the standby host goes down
          And gpstart is run with prompts accepted

         Then gpstart should print "Continue only if you are certain that the standby is not acting as the master." to stdout
          And gpstart should print "No standby master configured" to stdout
          And gpstart should return a return code of 0
          And all the segments are running
