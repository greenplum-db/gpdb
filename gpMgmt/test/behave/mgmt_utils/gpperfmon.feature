Feature: gpperfmon
    """
    Quantum controls how frequently text files get their data put in external tables.
    Note that only certain values are possible: 10, 15, 20, 30, 60.
    In this test setup, it's within the second quantum that the files are processed
    perhaps because of some initialization.
    So for quantum = 10, an initial query-log-to-external-table phase will take up to 20 seconds

    Harvest_interval controls how frequently the perfmon external tables are brought into the heap tables

    Important: for this behave to succeed on macOS, see steps in gpdb/gpAux/gpperfmon/README
