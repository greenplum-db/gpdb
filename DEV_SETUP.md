### Credits
This guide was developed in collaboration with Navneet Potti (@navsan) and
Nabarun Nag.

## Who should read this document?
Any new developer who wants to develop code for GPDB. This guide targets
the free-lance developers who typically has a laptop and wants to develop
GPDB code. In other words, such a typical developer does not necessarily have
24x7 access to a cluster, and need a miminal stand-alone development enviroment.
