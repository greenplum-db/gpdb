This directory contains a small utility for emulating network failures.
It is intended for testing failures between master and segments.

To use, load the library into the master's postmaster with LD_PRELOAD,
and set FLAKY_PORT to the port number of one of the segments. For example:

FLAKY_PORT=40004 LD_PRELOAD=flaky-wrap.so bin/postmaster -D data-master/ -E

Grep the logs for the string "FLAKY" to see what it's doing.
