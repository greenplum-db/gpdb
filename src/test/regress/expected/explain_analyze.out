NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause -- Using column named 'a' as the Greenplum Database data distribution key for this table.
HINT:  The 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause determines the distribution of data. Make sure column(s) chosen are the optimal data distribution key to minimize skew.
-- We used to incorrectly report "never executed" for a node that returns 0 rows
-- from every segment. This was misleading because "never executed" should
-- indicate that the node was never executed by its parent.
