What is gp-libpq-fe?

It's Greenplum modified libpq-fe.


Why it's needed?

Greenplum is a MPP system unlike PostgreSQL, it has communications between QD
and QEs other than clients to server. This requires libpq to carry more
information, and ignore some workflows such as authentication via unix domain
socket connection. And at the same time we must keep the standard libpq for
clients. So we have libpq-fe and gp-libpq-fe at the same time.


How this works?

1, gp-libpq-fe is built in server, libpq-fe is in the libpq.so.
2, we use gp-libpq-use.h and gp-libpq-unuse.h to rename structs, typedefs and
functions in this directory, which keeps tracks with upstream libpq and allows
using libpq and gp-libpq in the same process (think about dblink).


Please note:

List all the libpq-fe structs, typedefs and functions in gp-libpq-use.h and
gp-libpq-unuse.h, otherwise you will get warnings / errors while linking.
