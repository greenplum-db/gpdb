/*
 * Parameters gp_session_role and gp_role
 *
 * The run-time parameters (GUC variables) gp_session_role and
 * gp_role report and provide control over the role assumed by a
 * postgres process.
 *
 * Valid  roles are the following:
 *
 *	dispatch	The process acts as a parallel SQL dispatcher.
 *	execute		The process acts as a parallel SQL executor.
 *	utility		The process acts as a simple SQL engine.
 *
 * Both parameters are initialized to the same value at connection
 * time and are local to the backend process resulting from the
 * connection.	The default is dispatch which is the normal setting
 * for a user of Greenplum connecting to a node of  the Greenplum cluster.
 * Neither parameter appears in the configuration file.
 *
 * gp_session_role
 *
 * - does not affect the operation of the backend, and
 * - does not change during the lifetime of PostgreSQL session.
 *
 * gp_role
 *
 * - determines the operating role of the backend, and
 * - may be changed by a superuser via the SET command.
 *
 * The connection time value of gp_session_role used by a
 * libpq-based client application can be specified using the
 * environment variable PGOPTIONS.	For example, this is how to
 * invoke psql on database test as a utility:
 *
 *	PGOPTIONS='-c gp_session_role=utility' psql test
 *
 * Alternatively, libpq-based applications can be modified to set
 * the value directly via an argument to one of the libpq functions
 * PQconnectdb, PQsetdbLogin or PQconnectStart.
 *
 * Don't try to set gp_role this way.  At the time options are
 * processed it is unknown whether the user is a superuser, so
 * the attempt will be rejected.
 *
 * ----------
 *
 * Greenplum Developers can access the values of these parameters via the
 * global variables Gp_session_role and Gp_role of type
 * GpRoleValue. For example
 *
 *	#include "cdb/cdbvars.h"
 *
 *	switch ( Gp_role  )
 *	{
 *		case GP_ROLE_DISPATCH:
 *			... Act like a query dispatcher ...
 *			break;
 *		case GP_ROLE_EXECUTE:
 *			... Act like a query executor ...
 *			break;
 *		case GP_ROLE_UTILITY:
 *			... Act like an unmodified PostgreSQL backend. ...
 *			break;
 *		default:
 *			... Won't happen ..
 *			break;
 *	}
 *
 * You can also modify Gp_role (even if the session doesn't have
 * superuser privileges) by setting it to one of the three valid
 * values, however this must be well documented to avoid
 * disagreements between modules.  Don't modify the value  of
 * Gp_session_role.
 *
