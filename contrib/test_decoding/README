This file tell how to run test_decodings by hand.

1. Firstly, you need to change your system setting by the following command:

```
postgres=# show wal_level ;
 wal_level
-----------
 replica
(1 row)

postgres=# alter system set wal_level = logical;
ALTER SYSTEM
```

Then restart GPDB.
`gpstop -ar`

2. Secondly, you need to change the 'Makefile' of test_decoding:
Comment the line `NO_INSTALLCHECK = 1` by '#'

3. Thirdly, choose your testing suite file on the line behind 'REGRESS' and 'ISOLATION':
If you want to run 'distributed_transaction' and 'one_phase', you can write the
line like this:

REGRESS = distributed_transaction one_phase
and comment 'ISOLATION' like `#ISOLATION = ...`

4. Finally, you can run the testings by the following command:

`make installcheck`
