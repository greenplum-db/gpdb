      <p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> is a standard PostgreSQL utility for backing up a database, and is
        also supported in Greenplum Database. It creates a single (non-parallel) dump file. For
        routine backups of Greenplum Database, it is better to use the Greenplum Database backup
        utility, <a class="xref" href="gpbackup.html#topic1">gpbackup</a>, for the best performance.</p>

      <p class="p">Use <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> if you are migrating your data to another database vendor's
        system, or to another Greenplum Database system with a different segment configuration (for
        example, if the system you are migrating to has greater or fewer segment instances). To
        restore, you must use the corresponding <a class="xref" href="pg_restore.html#topic1">pg_restore</a> utility (if the dump file is in archive format), or you can use a client
        program such as <a class="xref" href="psql.html#topic1">psql</a> (if the dump file
        is in plain text format). </p>

      <p class="p">Since <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> is compatible with regular PostgreSQL, it can be used to
        migrate data into Greenplum Database. The <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> utility in Greenplum
        Database is very similar to the PostgreSQL <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> utility, with the
        following exceptions and limitations:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li" id="topic1__os142186">If using <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> to backup a Greenplum Database database,
          keep in mind that the dump operation can take a long time (several hours) for very large
          databases. Also, you must make sure you have sufficient disk space to create the dump
          file.</li>

        <li class="li" id="topic1__os142181">If you are migrating data from one Greenplum Database system to another,
          use the <code class="ph codeph">--gp-syntax</code> command-line option to include the
            <code class="ph codeph">DISTRIBUTED BY</code> clause in <code class="ph codeph">CREATE TABLE</code> statements. This
          ensures that Greenplum Database table data is distributed with the correct distribution
          key columns upon restore.</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> makes consistent backups even if the database is being used
        concurrently. <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> does not block other users accessing the database
        (readers or writers). </p>

      <p class="p">When used with one of the archive file formats and combined with
          <code class="ph codeph">pg_restore</code>, <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> provides a flexible archival and
        transfer mechanism. <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> can be used to backup an entire database, then
          <code class="ph codeph">pg_restore </code>can be used to examine the archive and/or select which parts
        of the database are to be restored. The most flexible output file formats are the
        <var class="keyword varname">custom</var> format (<code class="ph codeph">-Fc</code>) and the
        <var class="keyword varname">directory</var> format (<code class="ph codeph">-Fd</code>). They allow for selection and
        reordering of all archived items, support parallel restoration, and are compressed by
        default. The <var class="keyword varname">directory</var> format is the only format that supports parallel
        dumps.</p>

            <dd class="dd pd ddexpand">d | directory — Output a directory-format archive suitable for input into

            <dd class="dd pd ddexpand">Requesting exclusive locks on database objects while running a parallel dump could
              cause the dump to fail. The reason is that the <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> coordinator
              process requests shared locks on the objects that the worker processes are going to
              dump later in order to make sure that nobody deletes them and makes them go away while
              the dump is running. If another client then requests an exclusive lock on a table,
              that lock will not be granted but will be queued waiting for the shared lock of the
              coordinator process to be released. Consequently, any other access to the table will
              not be granted either and will queue after the exclusive lock request. This includes
              the worker process trying to dump the table. Without any precautions this would be a
              classic deadlock situation. To detect this conflict, the <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code>
              worker process requests another shared lock using the <code class="ph codeph">NOWAIT</code> option.
              If the worker process is not granted this shared lock, somebody else must have
              requested an exclusive lock in the meantime and there is no way to continue with the
              dump, so <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> has no choice but to cancel the dump.</dd>

            <dd class="dd pd ddexpand">For a consistent backup, the database server needs to support synchronized
              snapshots, a feature that was introduced in Greenplum Database 6.0. With this
              feature, database clients can ensure they see the same data set even though they
              use different connections. <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump -j</code> uses multiple database
              connections; it connects to the database once with the coordinator process and once
              again for each worker job. Without the synchronized snapshot feature, the
              different worker jobs wouldn't be guaranteed to see the same data in each
              connection, which could lead to an inconsistent backup.</dd>

            <dd class="dd pd ddexpand">If you want to run a parallel dump of a pre-6.0 server, you need to make sure
              that the database content doesn't change from between the time the coordinator connects
              to the database until the last worker job has connected to the database. The
              easiest way to do this is to halt any data modifying processes (DDL and DML)
              accessing the database before starting the backup. You also need to specify the
              <code class="ph codeph">--no-synchronized-snapshots</code> parameter when running

      <p class="p">The dump file produced by <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> does not contain the statistics used by
        the optimizer to make query planning decisions. Therefore, it is wise to run
          <code class="ph codeph">ANALYZE</code> after restoring from a dump file to ensure optimal
        performance.</p>

      <p class="p">The database activity of <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> is normally collected by the statistics
        collector. If this is undesirable, you can set parameter <code class="ph codeph">track_counts</code> to
        false via <code class="ph codeph">PGOPTIONS</code> or the <code class="ph codeph">ALTER USER</code> command.</p>

      <p class="p">Because <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> may be used to transfer data to newer versions of
        Greenplum Database, the output of <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> can be expected to load into
        Greenplum Database versions newer than <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code>'s version.
          <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> can also dump from Greenplum Database versions older than its own
        version. However, <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code> cannot dump from Greenplum Database versions
        newer than its own major version; it will refuse to even try, rather than risk making an
        invalid dump. Also, it is not guaranteed that <code class="ph codeph">pg_dump</code>'s output can be
        loaded into a server of an older major version — not even if the dump was taken from a
        server of that version. Loading a dump file into an older server may require manual editing
        of the dump file to remove syntax not understood by the older server. Use of the
          <code class="ph codeph">--quote-all-identifiers</code> option is recommended in cross-version cases, as
        it can prevent problems arising from varying reserved-word lists in different Greenplum
        Database versions.</p>

        you need to double-quote the name; else it will be folded to lower case. But double quotes
        are special to the shell, so in turn they must be quoted. Thus, to dump a single table with
        a mixed-case name, you need something like:</p>
