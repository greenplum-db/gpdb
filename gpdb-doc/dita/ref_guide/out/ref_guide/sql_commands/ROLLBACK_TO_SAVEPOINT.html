</p>
<p class="p">Specifying a savepoint name that has not been established is an error.</p>
<p class="p">Cursors have somewhat non-transactional behavior with respect to savepoints. Any cursor that is
                                opened inside a savepoint will be closed when the savepoint is
                                rolled back. If a previously opened cursor is affected by a
                                        <code class="ph codeph">FETCH</code> command inside a savepoint that is
                                later rolled back, the cursor remains at the position that
                                        <code class="ph codeph">FETCH</code> left it pointing to (that is, cursor
                                motion caused by <code class="ph codeph">FETCH</code> is not rolled back). Closing
                                a cursor is not undone by rolling back, either. However, other
                                side-effects caused by the cursor's query (such as side-effects of
                                volatile functions called by the query) are rolled back if they
                                occur during a savepoint that is later rolled back. A cursor whose
                                execution causes a transaction to end prematurely is put in a
                                cannot-execute state, so while the transaction can be restored using
                                        <code class="ph codeph">ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT</code>, the cursor can no
                                longer be used.</p>

<div class="section" id="topic1__section6"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Examples</h2><p class="p">To undo the effects of the commands run after <code class="ph codeph">my_savepoint</code> was
                                established:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;</code></pre><p class="p">Cursor positions are not affected by a savepoint rollback:</p>

<div class="section" id="topic1__section7"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compatibility</h2><p class="p">The SQL standard specifies that the key word <code class="ph codeph">SAVEPOINT</code>
is mandatory, but Greenplum Database (and Oracle) allow it to be omitted.
SQL allows only <code class="ph codeph">WORK</code>, not <code class="ph codeph">TRANSACTION</code>,
as a noise word after <code class="ph codeph">ROLLBACK</code>. Also, SQL has an optional
clause <code class="ph codeph">AND [NO] CHAIN</code> which is not currently supported
by Greenplum Database. Otherwise, this command conforms to the SQL standard.
