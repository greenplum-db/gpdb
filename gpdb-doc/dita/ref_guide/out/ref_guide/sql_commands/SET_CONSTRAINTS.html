         <p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS</code> sets the behavior of constraint checking within the
            current transaction. <code class="ph codeph">IMMEDIATE</code> constraints are checked at the end of
            each statement. <code class="ph codeph">DEFERRED</code> constraints are not checked until transaction
            commit. Each constraint has its own <code class="ph codeph">IMMEDIATE</code> or
               <code class="ph codeph">DEFERRED</code> mode. </p>

         <p class="p">Upon creation, a constraint is given one of three characteristics: <code class="ph codeph">DEFERRABLE
               INITIALLY DEFERRED</code>, <code class="ph codeph">DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE</code>, or
               <code class="ph codeph">NOT DEFERRABLE</code>. The third class is always <code class="ph codeph">IMMEDIATE</code>
            and is not affected by the <code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS</code> command. The first two
            classes start every transaction in the indicated mode, but their behavior can be changed
            within a transaction by <code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS</code>. </p>

         <p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS</code> with a list of constraint names changes the mode of
            just those constraints (which must all be deferrable). Each constraint name can be
            schema-qualified. The current schema search path is used to find the first matching name
            if no schema name is specified. <code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS ALL</code> changes the mode of
            all deferrable constraints. </p>

         <p class="p">When <code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS</code> changes the mode of a constraint from
               <code class="ph codeph">DEFERRED</code> to <code class="ph codeph">IMMEDIATE</code>, the new mode takes effect
            retroactively: any outstanding data modifications that would have been checked at the
            end of the transaction are instead checked during the execution of the <code class="ph codeph">SET
               CONSTRAINTS</code> command. If any such constraint is violated, the <code class="ph codeph">SET
               CONSTRAINTS</code> fails (and does not change the constraint mode). Thus,
               <code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS</code> can be used to force checking of constraints to
            occur at a specific point in a transaction. </p>

         <p class="p">Currently, only <code class="ph codeph">UNIQUE</code>, <code class="ph codeph">PRIMARY KEY</code>,
               <code class="ph codeph">REFERENCES</code> (foreign key), and <code class="ph codeph">EXCLUDE</code> constraints
            are affected by this setting. <code class="ph codeph">NOT NULL</code> and <code class="ph codeph">CHECK</code>
            constraints are always checked immediately when a row is inserted or modified
               (<em class="ph i">not</em> at the end of the statement). Uniqueness and exclusion constraints that
            have not been declared <code class="ph codeph">DEFERRABLE</code> are also checked immediately. </p>

         <p class="p">The firing of triggers that are declared as "constraint triggers" is also controlled by
            this setting â€” they fire at the same time that the associated constraint should be
            checked. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="section" id="topic1__section4"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Notes</h2>
         
         <p class="p">Because Greenplum Database does not require constraint names to be unique within a
            schema (but only per-table), it is possible that there is more than one match for a
            specified constraint name. In this case <code class="ph codeph">SET CONSTRAINTS</code> will act on all
            matches. For a non-schema-qualified name, once a match or matches have been found in
            some schema in the search path, schemas appearing later in the path are not searched. </p>

         <p class="p">This command only alters the behavior of constraints within the current transaction.
            Issuing this outside of a transaction block emits a warning and otherwise has no effect.
         </p>

      <div class="section" id="topic1__section5"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Compatibility</h2>
         
         <p class="p">This command complies with the behavior defined in the SQL standard, except for the
            limitation that, in Greenplum Database, it does not apply to <code class="ph codeph">NOT NULL</code>
            and <code class="ph codeph">CHECK</code> constraints. Also, Greenplum Database checks non-deferrable
            uniqueness constraints immediately, not at end of statement as the standard would
            suggest. </p>
