  <body>
    <p>This guide describes how to secure a Greenplum Database system. The guide assumes knowledge
      of Linux/UNIX system administration and database management systems. Familiarity with
      structured query language (SQL) is helpful.</p>
    <note type="important">VMware supports PostgresSQL 9.4 until VMware Tanzu Greenplum 6 is End of
      Support /End of Life (EOS/EOL). For the exact support period timeframes for each Tanzu
      Greenplum release, see the <b>Pivotal Product Support Lifecycle Matrix</b> at the <xref
        href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/support/lifecycle_policy" format="html" scope="external"
        >VMware Support Lifecycle Policy</xref> page.</note>
    <p>Because Greenplum Database is based on PostgreSQL 9.4, this guide assumes some familiarity
      with PostgreSQL. References to <xref
        href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/index.html" scope="external" format="html"
          ><ph>PostgreSQL documentation</ph></xref> are provided throughout this guide for features
      that are similar to those in Greenplum Database.</p>
    <p>This information is intended for system administrators responsible for administering a
      Greenplum Database system.</p>
