  <title>Character Encoding</title>
  <body>
    <p>Character encoding systems consist of a code that pairs each character from a character set
      with something else, such as a sequence of numbers or octets, to facilitate data stransmission
      and storage. Greenplum Database supports a variety of character sets, including
      single-byte character sets such as the ISO 8859 series and multiple-byte character sets such
      as EUC (Extended UNIX Code), UTF-8, and Mule internal code. The server-side character set
      is defined during database initialization, usually UTF-8 is used. Clients can use all supported
      character sets transparently, but a few are not supported for use within the server as a
      server-side encoding. When loading or inserting data into Greenplum Database, the DBMS will
      transparently transform the data from the specified client encoding into the server encoding.
      When sending data back to the client, the data is transformed again from the server character
      set into the specified client encoding.</p>
    <p>Data files must be in a character encoding recognized by Greenplum Database.
        <ph>See the <i>Greenplum Database Reference Guide</i> for the supported
        character sets. </ph>Data files that contain invalid or unsupported encoding sequences
      encounter errors when loading into Greenplum Database.</p>
    <note type="note">On data files generated on a Microsoft Windows operating system, run the
        <codeph>dos2unix</codeph> system command to remove any Windows-only characters before
      loading into Greenplum Database.</note>

    <title>Changing the client-side character encoding</title>
    <body>
      <p>The client-side character encoding can be changed on the fly:</p>
      <p>
        <codeblock>SET client_encoding TO 'latin1';
</codeblock>
