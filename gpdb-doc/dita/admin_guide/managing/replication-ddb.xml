    <title>Replicating Backups</title>

      <p>You can use <codeph><xref href="../../utility_guide/ref/gpbackup.xml"

        with the DD Boost storage plugin to replicate a backup from one Data Domain system to a
        second, remote, Data Domain system for disaster recovery. You can replicate a backup as part
        of the backup process, or replicate an existing backup set as a separate operation. Both
        methods require a <xref href="backup-ddboost-plugin.xml#topic_ddb-plugin/ddb-plugin-config"
          >DD Boost configuration file</xref> that includes options that specify Data Domain system
        locations and DD Boost configuration. The DD Boost storage plugin replicates the backup set
        on the remote Data Domain system with DD Boost managed file replication. </p>
      <ul id="ul_n4s_rrq_nkb">
        <li>The <codeph>gpbackup</codeph> utility can replicate a backup set as part of the backup
            process.<p>To enable replication during a back up, add the backup replication options to
            the configuration file. Set the the configuration file <codeph>replication</codeph>
            option to <codeph>on</codeph> and add the options that the plugin uses to access the
            remote Data Domain system that stores the replicated backup.</p><p>When using
              <codeph>gpbackup</codeph>, the <codeph>replication</codeph> option must be set to
              <codeph>on</codeph>. The configuration file <codeph>replication-streams</codeph>
            option is ignored, the default value is used. </p>Performing a backup operation with
          replication increases the time required to perform a backup. The backup set is copied to
          the local Data Domain system, and then replicated on the remote Data Domain system using
          DD Boost managed file replication. The backup operation completes after the backup set is
          replicated on the remote system.</li>
        <li>The <codeph>gpbackup_manager replicate-backup</codeph> command can replicate an existing
          backup set created by <codeph>gpbackup</codeph>.<p>To replicate an existing backup set,
            run <codeph>backup_manager replicate-backup</codeph> and specify a DD Boost
            configuration file. The configuration file contains the same type of information that is
            in the configuration file used to replicate a backup set with <codeph>gpbackup</codeph>.
            </p><p>When using the <codeph>gpbackup_manager replicate-backup</codeph> command, the
            configuration file <codeph>replication</codeph> option is ignored. The command always
            attempts to replicate a back up.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>When replicating a backup, the Data Domain system where the backup is stored must have
        access to the remote Data Domain system where the replicated backup is stored. </p>
      <p>To restore data from a replicated backup, you can use <codeph><xref
            href="../../utility_guide/ref/gprestore.xml">gprestore</xref></codeph> with the DD Boost
        storage plugin and specify the location of the backup in the DD Boost configuration file.
