**Note:** The `pg_resgroupcapability` system catalog table is valid only when resource group-based resource management is active.

The `pg_resgroupcapability` system catalog table contains information about the capabilities and limits of defined Greenplum Database resource groups. You can join this table to the [pg\_resgroup](pg_resgroup.html) table by resource group object ID.

The `pg_resgroupcapability` table, defined in the `pg_global` tablespace, is globally shared across all databases in the system.
