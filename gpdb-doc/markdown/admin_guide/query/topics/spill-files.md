# Managing Spill Files Generated by Queries 

Greenplum Database creates spill files, also known as workfiles, on disk if it does not have sufficient memory to execute an SQL query in memory.The default value of 100,000 spill files is sufficient for the majority of queries. However, if a query creates more than the specified number of spill files, Greenplum Database returns this error:

```
ERROR: number of workfiles per query limit exceeded
```

Reasons that cause a large number of spill files to be generated include:

-   Data skew is present in the queried data.
-   The amount memory allocated for the query is too low.

You might be able to run the query successfully by changing the query, changing the data distribution, or changing the system memory configuration. You can use the *gp\_workfile\_\** views to see spill file usage information. You can control the maximum amount of memory that can used by a query with the Greenplum Database server configuration parameters `max_statement_mem`, `statement_mem`, or through resource queues.

[Monitoring a Greenplum System](../../managing/monitor.html) contains the following information:

-   Information about skew and how to check for data skew
-   Information about using the *gp\_workfile\_\* views*

For information about server configuration parameters, see the *Greenplum Database Reference Guide*. For information about resource queues, see [Using Resource Queues](../../workload_mgmt.html).

If you have determined that the query must create more spill files than allowed by the value of server configuration parameter `gp_workfile_limit_files_per_query`, you can increase the value of the parameter.
