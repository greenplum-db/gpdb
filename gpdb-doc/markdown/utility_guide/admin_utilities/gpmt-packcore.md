# gpmt packcore 

This tool collects all the necessary files and generates a script that runs the `gdb` command to create a core file readable by an external host. Use this command when VMware Support needs to collect core files generated by the Greenplum processes.

## Usage 

```
**gpmt** **packcore** **collect** -core COREFILE [-binary BINARY ] 
[-keep\_tmp\_dir] [-ignore\_missing\] 
```

## Options 

-core
:   Corefile name.

-binary
:   Binary name that generated the core file.

-keep\_tmp\_dir
:   Do not delete the temporary directory.

-ignore\_missing
:   Ignore missing libraries.

## Examples 

Collect core info for `core.1234` for binary `/usr/local/greenplum-db/bin/postgres`.

```
gpmt packcore -cmd collect -core core.1234 -binary /usr/local/greenplum-db/bin/postgres
```
