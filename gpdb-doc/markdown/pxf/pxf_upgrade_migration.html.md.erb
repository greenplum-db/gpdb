title: PXF Upgrade and Migration
---
When you upgrade your Greenplum Database system, you must perform some additional steps in order to bring your PXF configuration up to date.

Note that if you are upgrading or migrating from Greenplum Database 5.x to Greenplum Database 6.x and were previously using the `gphdfs` external table protocol to access data stored in Hadoop, you must first [migrate your gphdfs external tables](gphdfs-pxf-migrate.html) to use PXF instead, since Greenplum Database version 6 removes support for the `gphdfs` protocol.

There are four possible scenarios:

1. Upgrading PXF [during a gpupgrade-based Greenplum Database 5.x to 6.x Upgrade](../../pxf/latest/using/upgrade_gpupgrade.html).
1. Upgrading PXF after [migrating from Greenplum Database 5.x to 6.x](migrate_5to6.html).
1. Upgrading PXF after [upgrading Greenplum Database from a previous 6.x version](upgrade_pxf_6x.html). Note that different steps are outlined based on your PXF installation source: a manually installed `rpm` or `deb` package downloaded from Tanzu Network, or the PXF version included with the Greenplum Database Server installer in versions 6.18.x and older. 
1. If you are upgrading a PXF `rpm` or `deb` installation independent of a Greenplum Database upgrade, refer to the [PXF upgrade documentation](../../pxf/latest/using/upgrade_landing.html).
