title: Configuring PXF Hadoop Connectors
---

This topic describes how configure the PXF Hadoop, Hive, and HBase connectors. PXF is compatible with Cloudera, Hortonworks Data Platform, and generic Apache Hadoop distributions.

*If you do not plan to use the Hadoop-related PXF connectors, you need not perform the procedure in this topic.*

## <a id="client-pxf-prereq"></a>Prerequisites

Before configuring PXF Hadoop, Hive, and HBase connectors, ensure that you have:

- `scp` access to hosts running the HDFS, Hive, and HBase services in your Hadoop cluster.


## <a id="client-pxf-config-steps"></a>Procedure

Perform the following procedure to configure the desired PXF Hadoop-related connectors on each segment host in your Greenplum Database cluster. You will use the `gpssh` utility where possible to run a command on multiple hosts.

1. Log in to your Greenplum Database master node and set up the environment:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ . /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

2. PXF requires information from `core-site.xml` and other Hadoop configuration files. Copy relevant HDFS, Hive, and HBase configuration from your Hadoop cluster to each Greenplum Database segment host. You will use the `gpscp` utility to copy files to multiple hosts.

    1. Copy the `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, `mapred-site.xml`, and `yarn-site.xml` Hadoop configuration files from your Hadoop cluster NameNode host to the current host. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml .
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml .
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/mapred-site.xml .
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hdfsuser@namenode:/etc/hadoop/conf/yarn-site.xml .
        ```
        
    2. Next, copy these Hadoop configuration files to the `/etc/hadoop/conf` directory on each Greenplum Database segment host. You may need to create this directory. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile core-site.xml =:/etc/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile hdfs-site.xml =:/etc/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile mapred-site.xml =:/etc/hadoop/conf/mapred-site.xml
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile yarn-site.xml =:/etc/hadoop/conf/yarn-site.xml
        ```

2. If you plan to use the PXF Hive connector to access Hive table data, copy Hive configuration to each Greenplum Database segment host.
    
    1. Copy the `hive-site.xml` Hive configuration file from one of the hosts on which your Hive service is running to the current host. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hiveuser@hivehost:/etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml .
        ```

    2. Next, copy the `hive-site.xml` configuration file to the `/etc/hive/conf` directory on each Greenplum Database segment host. You may need to create this directory. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile hive-site.xml =:/etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml

3. If you plan to use the PXF HBase connector to access HBase table data, copy HBase configuration to each Greenplum Database segment host.
    
    1. Copy the `hbase-site.xml` HBase configuration file from one of the hosts on which your HBase service is running to the current host. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp hbaseuser@hbasehost:/etc/hive/conf/hbase-site.xml .
        ```

    2. Next, copy the `hbase-site.xml` configuration file to the `/etc/hbase/conf` directory on each Greenplum Database segment host. You may need to create this directory. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ gpscp -v -f seghostfile hive-site.xml =:/etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml


4. PXF accesses Hadoop services on behalf of Greenplum Database end users. By default, PXF tries to access HDFS, Hive, and HBase using the identity of the Greenplum Database user account that logs into Greenplum Database. In order to support this functionality, you must configure proxy settings for Hadoop, as well as for Hive and HBase if you intend to use those PXF connectors. Follow procedures in [Configuring User Impersonation and Proxying](pxfuserimpers.html) to configure user impersonation and proxying for Hadoop services, or to turn off PXF user impersonation.

5. Grant read permission to the HDFS files and directories that will be accessed as external tables in Greenplum Database. If user impersonation is enabled (the default), you must grant this permission to each Greenplum Database user/role name that will use external tables that reference the HDFS files. If user impersonation is not enabled, you must grant this permission to the `gpadmin` user.

6. If your Hadoop cluster is secured with Kerberos, you must configure PXF and generate Kerberos principals and keytabs for each segment host as described in [Configuring PXF for Secure HDFS](pxf_kerbhdfs.html).


## <a id="client-cfg-update"></a>Updating Hadoop Configuration

If you update your Hadoop, Hive, or HBase configuration while the PXF service is running, you must copy the updated `.xml` file(s) to each Greenplum Database segment host and restart PXF.
